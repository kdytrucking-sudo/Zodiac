## 🎥 Recording Tips

### 1. **Slow and Deliberate Actions**

- **TikTok OAuth page**: Pause for 3-5 seconds to show scopes clearly
- **Publish ID**: Show this clearly on the success page
- **User interactions**: Make mouse movements smooth and visible

### 3. **Smooth Transitions**
- Avoid sudden jumps or cuts in the video
- Let pages fully load before proceeding
- Use fade transitions if editing multiple clips together

### 4. **Clear Subtitles**
- Use high-contrast colors (white on black, or black on white)
- Ensure text is large enough to read easily
- Keep subtitle text on screen long enough to read (minimum 2 seconds)

### 5. **Professional Presentation**
- Remove personal information from browser (bookmarks, extensions)
- Use a neutral desktop background
- Close chat applications and email clients
- Mute notifications

### 6. **Error Handling**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. **TikTok OAuth Page Not Loading**
**Problem**: Clicking share button doesn't redirect to TikTok  
**Solution**:
- Verify `client_key` is correct in `tiktok-video.mjs`
- Check that redirect_uri matches TikTok app settings exactly
- Ensure scopes are comma-separated with no spaces
- Test OAuth URL directly in browser

#### 2. **Video Preview Not Loading**
**Problem**: Modal opens but video doesn't play  
**Solution**:
- Check that mock video URL is accessible
- Verify video format is compatible (MP4 recommended)
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Test video URL directly in browser

#### 3. **Authorization Fails (403 Error)**
**Problem**: After authorizing, receive 403 Forbidden error  
**Solution**:
- In demo video, you can record up to the authorization step
- Add subtitle: "Production approval required for public posting"
- Show that OAuth flow completes successfully
- Explain in application that testing is in sandbox mode

#### 4. **File Size Too Large**
**Problem**: Video exceeds 50MB limit  
**Solution**:
- Reduce recording resolution to 720p
- Lower frame rate to 30fps
- Trim unnecessary footage
- Use HandBrake or FFmpeg to compress

#### 5. **Subtitles Not Visible**
**Problem**: Subtitle text blends with background  
**Solution**:
- Add thick black outline or background box
